# vendingmachine

 The vending machine is an automated machine that dispenses various products such as snacks, beverages, newspapers, tickets etc to customers when money or credit card is inserted. Vending machines are more accessible and practical than the convention purchasing method Now, vending machine market is a big business with huge annual revenue for leading nations like The USA, Japan, China and some other Asian countries including India. The paper aims to design a vending machine that can dispense three products of different prices with additional features of ‘return change’ when a coin of higher denomination is inserted and ‘return money’ when request is cancelled. The machine accepts coins of denominations five and ten. The finite state machine (FSM) approach is adopted for the design of vending machine. The design is achieved by formulating the Verilog code for the FSM-based machine using behavioural modeling and simulating the testbench for three products using Xilinx ISE tool.
